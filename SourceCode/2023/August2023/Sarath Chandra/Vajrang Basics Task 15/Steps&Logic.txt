Step1: Create an input excel.
Step 2: Read that excel data and loop all the values. Assign all data into one variable.
Step3: Write into a excel.
    3.1: To write data into incrementing value of columns i.e.(D2,D3,D4) we need to use the below syntax in the cellID option in write cell workbook activity.
    3.2: To use the below syntax, we'll need to assign another variable(int32) to save the CellID for every loop. To start with, we create the variable from properties panel of For each row data table(Index option).
    3.3: For every loop the increment must go on so we save the value of variable with the starting value of cell i.e. if the full name should start from D2, then we save it as variable+2


Syntax for increment in cell ID

IncrementVar+2=D2   this will be the first value to save since the first Full name should be saved in D2

0+2=2=D2
1+2=3=D3
2+2=4=D4
3+2=5=D5
